# Maze Solver

Maze Solver solves a maze created with Maze Generator, adds an info display and a slow mode for viewing the operation in a more step-by-step fashion. In effect, it generates a maze using the Maze Generator, and then solves a route from any cell A to any other cell B within it, marking the attempted route by yellow color, and, when finding the goal, the correct passage by red color.
