# RealTime3DwithPython/Sound Vision

A Python reproduction of a 1992 Amiga demo "Sound Vision" by Reflect. See https://archive.assembly.org/1992/amiga-demo/sound-vision-by-reflect

The demo consists of eleven independent parts. The credits for the pictures and music are given in the demo, only the code is mine.
