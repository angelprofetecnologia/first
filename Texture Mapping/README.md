# Texture Mapping

Texture Mapping does Affine Texture Mapping on convex flat surfaces in 3D space using Python, NumPy and CPU for calculations (each pixel calculated in this module) and pygame for display. There's a _tutorial mode_ which shows the mapping sections on both the original still image and the 3D rotated surface. (Set _self.tutorial_mode_ to True for tutorial mode.)
